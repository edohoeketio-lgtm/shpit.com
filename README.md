# shp.it

The fastest way to share your local dev server with the world.

## How to use

Run the following command in any project directory:

```bash
npx @skxng/shpit --port 8080
```

*Replace `8080` with the port your local server is running on (e.g., `3000` for Next.js).*

That's it! It securely tunnels your localhost, grabs an `is.gd` short URL, and prints it in your terminal.
